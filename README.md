# odin-recipes-two

This project features the same content as the first odin-recipes made by html only. This time, odin-recipes-two will be created using HTML, CSS, and everything I learned from the previous lessons.

Note: odin-recipes-two is not a project tasked by Odin Project, it is only my personal project after learning how to write CSS and apply style declarations. It will not be showcased in the community solutions.

Update: The project may will be incomplete or may be not completed immediately as this is just for practice purposes. Also, the design may be similar to "The Odin Project" and "Allrecipes" as I stated are for practice purposes only.
