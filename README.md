# odin-recipes-two

This project features the same content as the first odin-recipes made by html only. This time, odin-recipes-two will be created using HTML, CSS, and everything I learned from the previous lessons.

Note: odin-recipes-two is not a project tasked by Odin Project, it is only my personal project after learning how to write CSS and apply style declarations. It will not be showcased in the community solutions.
